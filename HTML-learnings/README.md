# 🌐 HTML Learnings – Web Dev Journey

Welcome to the `HTML-learnings` folder of my **Web Development Learning Journey**!  
This section contains hands-on practice files and assets I’ve used while learning HTML fundamentals.  
Each file serves a specific purpose and reflects progress made while experimenting with tags, structure, forms, and media.
